# Avengers_Face_Classification
A computer vision aided Face Classification model that classifies the actors from the Avengers Franchise into one out of 5 of the most popular actors in the franchise. The Classifier is built using OpenCV's inbuilt face classifier model based on haarCascades.

Avengers actors' facial image dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/avengers-faces-dataset .

# Improvements
Improvements upon the project by adding more actors's data sets are welcome. Make sure changing the [actors] list upon addition of new actor (that's pretty much the only change needed upon dataset updatiom (: ).
